<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
            
<h3> CS 265/571 Advanced Programming Techniques </h3>
<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p> The purpose of this assignment is for students to become comfortable
using Unix filters (including Awk) to solve text processing problems.
Students will also write a simple shell script. Students will also need to
become comfortable using Unix (basic commands, documentation, file
redirection - i.e. the bash shell), a Unix editor, the Unix file system.
Unix filters, in addition to Awk, that might be useful are cut, grep, sort,
uniq, wc. You may also want to use the option -R to grep and ls which causes
the command to be applied recursively to all subdirectories of the directory
in which it is called.  Or, you might find that the find utility is more
useful. </p>

<p> The text data that will be used is a directory of email messages sent by
the Math Doctors associated with the <a href="http://www.mathforum.org/dr.math/">Math Forum's Ask Dr. Math</a>
service during several months. The data is organized into directories whose
name is a number. Each directory contains text files with emails that were
sent about different problems (one message per file). There may be several
emails about the same problem - this is called a thread. The files are
labeled by the problem number and a second number indicating which message
in a given thread it is. E.G. prob309264_03, indicates that the file
contains the third message in the thread associated with problem 309264.
Note that the data set we are using only contains the messages sent by the
Math Doctors, the corresponding messages sent by students asking the
question and following up on the advice sent by the Math Doctor are not
included. The file <a href="https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~kschmidt/CS265/Assignments/Bash-DrMath2/Archive/309/prob309264_03">prob309264_03</a>
contains a sample message. Notice that the email contains a header with
information on the thread number, the Math Doctor who sent the message and
the date and time the message was sent.</p>

<p> The data can be obtained from: </p>

<blockquote><tt>
/home/kschmidt/public_html/Files/DrMathArchive
</tt></blockquote>

<p> You will need to logon to the CS Linux machines (e.g. tux.cs.drexel.edu)
to access this data. Note that the data is large (119 MB) with many files,
so you should not copy the entire data set to your account or computer. You
should copy a couple of the numbered subdirectories to experiment with
before working on the entire data set. </p>

<p> The following problems ask you to find out information about the messages
and Math Doctors in the data set. You should do so with Unix filters (you
may need to combine several filters using a pipe), simple Unix Scripts, or
Awk programs. There are many different ways you can solve the problem - we
are not looking for a particular solution, but for effective use of the Unix
tools that we have been discussing in class. </p>

<p> The data set covers an 11-month span, though not all in the same
year.  (Be careful; we will test on a subset of the data, so you should not
make assumptions about the data, e.g., the timespan that is covered, etc.)
</p>

<p> You should always try your solution on a small subset of the data so that
it does not take long to run while you are working things out and so that
you can test the correctness of your answer (you will not be able to test
the correctness of your solution on the entire data set by manually looking
at all of the files - there are too many of them). If you get stuck please
ask one of the instructors or TAs for help. You may also post questions to
the class mailing list. </p>

<h2> Problems </h2> 

<p> For each problem, submit a script, desribed below, that outputs the
requested output (and just the requested output; I don't want to see "The
answer is ___", or "The number of tribbles is ___".  Consider <tt>ls</tt> or
<tt>head</tt>; they don't print silly stuff, either) to stdout.  the Unix
commands, scripts, programs that you used. You should also indicate how you
tested your solution on a small data set. Provide sufficient documentation
explaining your approach. </p>

<p> Use a variable, called <tt>ARCHIVE</tt>, to point to the directory that
contains the archive of messages that to be studied used.  That is, do
<em>not</em> hardcode any paths, directories, etc., into your scripts. </p>

<p> This way, you can use the same scripts on your test data and the actual
data.  Also, if the actual data moved, the scripts can easily be
reconfigured.  Finally, we can test your scripts with another data set. </p>

<p> Here are your problems: </p>

<ol>
	<li> Determine the number of directories containing problems. Observe that
	there is only one message per file.  What is the total number of messages
	sent?  Output 2 columns on a single line, the # of directories, and the
	total # of messages sent. </li>

	<li> Determine how many messages are in the longest thread.  List all of
	the threads that are of that length.  Here it might be helpful to write
	(maybe) a temp file w/2 columns, sorting on the second column in an
	intelligent way, and the using bash's <tt>read</tt>, or Awk to find the
	lines you want.  Note, a suffix of _6 does not necessarily mean that the
	previous 5 messages exist. </li>

	<li> Write a script that takes, as command-line arguments, the year,
	month and day, in that order.  E.g.:
		<blockquote><tt><pre>prob3 2003 11 27</pre></tt></blockquote>
	, and returns a list of messages that were sent on that day. </li>

	<li> In each message, pull out the target hostname (<em>not</em> the full
	email address) from the To: line (be careful about finding quoted To:
	lines).  How many distinct hostnames are there?  Note, hostnames on the
	Internet are case insensitive.  How many messages were sent to each (for
	this you'll need sort, and you'll want to look at the <tt>squash</tt> awk
	script in the anagram lab from the Awk lecture).
	
	<p> Output 2 columns, the hostname and the # of messages sent there, 1
	record per line, sorted by column 2, in descending order.  The last line
	shall be "total <i>nnn</i>", where <i>nnn</i> is the total # of distinct
	hostnames.
	</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3> Grading </h3>

<p> Each problem will be worth 20%, with 20% reserved for coding style,
comments, the ability to follow directions, the README, etc. </p>
       
<h2> Submission </h2>

<p> Submit the following files, via <tt>submit_cl</tt>: </p>

<ul>
	<li> <tt><b>prob1</b></tt> </li>
	<li> <tt><b>prob2</b></tt> </li>
	<li> <tt><b>prob3</b></tt> </li>
	<li> <tt><b>prob4</b></tt> </li>
	<li> <tt><b>README</b></tt> – A description of the files submitted,
		a quick description of what is required to run them, and anything you
		want to tell us before we grade. </li>
</ul>

<p>, where each <tt><b>prob<i>n</i></b></tt> is a bash file, with execute
permissions set, and the proper sha-bang (we might be grading from the
Midnight Commander Shell; who knows?). </p>

<p> Each script should have comments explaining what the script does.  Your
script may call additional scripts or programs (Awk) in other files and
temporary files may be created - if so this should be documented.  Make sure
that the problem can be solved simply by executing your main script. </p>

<p> For example, while testing using the entire archive, you might do
this: </p>

<blockquote><tt>
<pre>ARCHIVE=/home/kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Assignments/DrMath/Archive&nbsp;./prob3</pre>
</tt></blockquote>

<p> Or, define it in your environment, <em>export</em> it, and run your
program: </p>

<blockquote><code>
<pre>ARCHIVE=/home/kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Assignments/DrMath/Archive
export ARCHIVE
./prob3</pre>
</code></blockquote>

<p> Do <strong>not</strong> set this variable in your scripts (or, check to
see that it is unset before modifying it).  We will want to set it to a
directory of <em>our</em> choosing. </p>

<p> Create a subdirectory which contains the test data you used.  This data
set should contain a few directories each with a few messages.  It provides
a quick way to test your code and you should use it to test your code
yourself. </p>

<p> Do NOT submit temporary files, nor your test data.  Just the required
scripts, and any helper files. </p>

<p> All assignments should be submitted using <tt>submit_cli</tt> (please contact
one of the TAs or instructor if you have not done this previously).  </p>
